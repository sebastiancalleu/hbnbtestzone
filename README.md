# AirBnB clone - The console

This project consist about how to build a console that is a copy of the AirBnB project, this is just the first steep to build the whole project call AirBnB.


## What is the console and how works?

The interpreter uses a loop to read all lines from its input, parse them, and then dispatch the command to an appropriate command handler.

Input lines are parsed into two parts. The command, and any other text on the line.

## What can the interpreter do?

-   Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Update attributes of an object
-   Destroy an object
